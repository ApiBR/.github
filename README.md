## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

GitHub automatically applies the files from this `.github` repository to **all organization repositories** unless they include their own versions of the same files. This ensures every project starts with solid community and contribution standards.

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Customization

To override or extend the defaults for a specific repository:
- Add your custom file (e.g. `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`) to that repository.
- GitHub will use the local version instead of the one in `.github`.
